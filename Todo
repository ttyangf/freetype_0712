Current topic: Fix decoder initialisation to CF2 intrp in T1 mode
for: Merge CF2 (Adobe) and Type 1 interpreters.

TODO:
* Decoder
  . Type 1 mode decoder initialisation (CFF unchanged)
  . decoder->cff is missing for Type 1 mode. Fix init
  . Ensure all original decoder fields are referenced not copied
* seac
  . Fix
* callsubr
  . Check: pop value might not be int (>1131) for Type 1 

NOTE:
* callothersubr
.  OtherSubrs 20~28 duplicate escape operations (add, sub, ..etc.)
.  Known OtherSubr results are still pushed automatically.
* Builders
.  differing fields :
    face,         TT_Face extends FT_Face
    glyph,        CFF_GlyphSlot extends FT_GlyphSlot
.   funcs         Use (merged) ps_builder_ funcs
* Left sidebearing (lsb)
.  cff does not set this in CF2. In CFF only if invalid hsbw/sbw is accepted.
